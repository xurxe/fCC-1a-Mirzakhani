                    <p>
                        Maryam Mirzakhani was one of the most brilliant mathematicians of her generation.
                        She dedicated most of her career to advanced geometry topics
                        such as hyperbolic geometry, Teichmüller theory, symplectic geometry, and ergodic theory.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Mirzakhani's contributions revolutionized not only mathematics, but physics and geology as well.
                        As a woman of color from a Muslim cultural background, she will forever remain a role model to people and demographics underrepresented in STEM fields.
